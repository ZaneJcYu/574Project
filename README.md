## Exploring single-cell perturbation marker genes using classification methods for high-dimensional data

### Introduction
we are going to inspect the performance of classification methods using high-dimensional features.
We consider aspects of prediction accuarcy and model interpretability based on a particular domain knowledge to
evaluate the performance for each method in this report.
